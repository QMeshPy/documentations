## Pick Your Path

### I want what just shipped in the product repo
**→** [Recent updates](/docs/recent-updates)

Merged PRs from `QMeshPy/distributed-quantum` (billing, SIWE, Starknet sessions, provenance, VAULT, chains).

### I want payments, credits, or worker payouts
**→** [Payments](/docs/payments)

Ledger model, Stripe credit packs / USDC, and Connect vs on-chain payout decision.

### I want VAULT / IPFS sharing
**→** [VAULT / IPFS](/docs/vault)

Open any CID, trustless gateways, circuit publish, run↔circuit links.

### I want to understand the system architecture
**→** [Architecture](/docs/architecture)

Full end-to-end architecture, component breakdown, Mermaid diagrams, state machines.

### I want the research paper (QAOA + portfolio optimization)
**→** [Research paper draft](/docs/research/paper)

~15,000 words · 9 sections · publication-ready. All experiments, benchmarks, and findings.

### I want implementation/technical notes
**→** [Implementation notes](/docs/technical/implementation)

Complete optimization journey — bottleneck discovery, Phase 1 fix, Phase 2 failure, Phase 3 pivot.

### I want mathematical proofs
**→** [Mathematical appendix](/docs/research/mathematical-appendix)

~8,000 words of rigorous derivations: QUBO→Ising, parameter-shift rule, Amdahl's Law proofs.

### I want the current quantum scaling strategy
**→** [Quantum scaling strategy](/docs/research/scaling-strategy)

Why we pivoted from speed tricks to scaling demonstration. Crossover predictions, success criteria.

### I want to understand what failed
**→** [Gradient postmortem](/docs/technical/gradient-postmortem)

Honest analysis: parameter-shift gradients were 2–3× slower. Root cause: 8× evaluation overhead.

### I want to deploy the platform
**→** [Deployment manual](/docs/deployment) then [Lightsail deployment](/docs/deployment)

### I want to understand finance theory and the quantum use case
**→** [Financial modeling](/docs/financial-modeling)

Track A (corporate finance) vs Track B (quantum finance optimization) — which problem fits quantum.

### I want the long-term product roadmap
**→** [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap)

5-milestone evolution: SDK platform → open node network → research engine → service swarm → self-healing.

### I want alternative quantum finance problems (backup plan)
**→** [Alternative quantum finance problems](/docs/research/alternative-problems)

Option pricing QAE (proven 100× speedup), credit risk, yield curves.

## Research Summary (30-second read)

**Question**: Can quantum optimize portfolios faster than classical?

| Scale | Classical | Quantum | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤ 20 assets | **Fast** | 50–100× slower | Classical |
| ≥ 40 assets | Exponential | ~Constant | **Quantum** |

**Bottleneck**: 97% of quantum runtime is classical COBYLA parameter search — not the quantum circuit.

**Key insight**: Advantage comes from *scaling behavior*, not raw speed.
